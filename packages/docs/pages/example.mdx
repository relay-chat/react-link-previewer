# Example article with link previews

Today we'll build a simple news app using [News API](https://newsapi.org), [Preact](https://preactjs.com) as UI library, [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for styling and [DinoQL](https://github.com/victorvoid/dinoql) for parsing data.

## Get API Key

Register on [News API](https://newsapi.org)

Then go to your [account](https://newsapi.org/account) and take the key.

## Setup the project

Just execute all these commands in your terminal.

```shell
mkdir news-app
cd news-app
yarn init -y
yarn add preact@beta dinoql dotenv styled-components
yarn add -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react parcel-bundler
```

Here we create a directory where we will work, then initialize a new node.js project and add dependencies.

Also you should copy the key from your account and put it into .env file like this:

```
TOKEN=1234567890
```

To make Preact work with other React libraries (`styled-components` in our case), we need to write an alias for Parcel in our `package.json` file:

```json
"alias": {
  "react": "preact/compat",
  "react-dom": "preact/compat"
}
```

Sometimes Babel is glitchy without a config, so better to create a `.babelrc` file to list our presets:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

And for convenience, create a new npm script to launch Parcel automatically on port 80 with opening a new tab:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "parcel index.html --port 80 --open"
}
```

As you can see we set target to `index.html`. That's because Parcel needs an html file to attach a bundled script there. So you should create an `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>News App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

That's all we need to make everything work, now try `yarn dev`.

## How it will work

First, our app fetches data from API. Then this data is parsed with DinoQL. After that, we put our parsed values into layout.

## Describing the stack

**Why Preact?** It is 2x smaller than React so it is faster.

**Why DinoQL?** Dealing with pure JSON is not comfortable enough. DinoQL parses objects in a GraphQL manner.

**Why styled-components?** Because pure CSS sometimes mixes up and produces weird layout.

## Let's code!

### Checking `process.env.TOKEN`

First, we need to setup `dotenv` to get TOKEN environment variable.

```js
import { config } from 'dotenv'
config()
console.log(process.env.TOKEN)
```

Look at the console, it should output the key. If it works, we can begin writing components.

### Components

Because some styles are applied by default, we need to change them using `createGlobalStyle` from Styled Components:

```js
import React from 'react'
import { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components'
import { config } from 'dotenv'
config()

const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    height: 100vh;
    display: grid;
    place-items: center
  }
```

Here we removed default margin and set our content position to center.

Let's style components. You can do it as you want, I used these styles:

```js
const Results = styled.ul`
  list-style-type: none;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  width: 70vw;
`

const Input = styled.input`
  font-size: calc(100% + 1.4vw);
  border: 3px solid black;
  padding: 0.2em;
`

const Header = styled.h1`
  font-size: calc(100% + 4vw);
`
```

Styling is finished, now we will write the main `<App />` component.

### App itself

We'll use two states - one for input, another for articles we get from News API. So when something new is in input field, data is automatically fetched. "Automatic fetching" is called a **side effect** in React. For applying side effects when state is changed, we use `useEffect` hook.

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

const App = () => {
  const [results, setResults] = useState({ articles: []})
  // Our first search request will be "JavaScript"
  const [val, setVal] = useState('JavaScript')

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${val}&sortBy=popularity&apiKey=${process.env.TOKEN}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
```

According to [docs](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started), we'll get this kind of JSON:

```json

    "totalResults": 1291,
    "articles": [

It is quite uneasy to manipulate. And we're lucky that we only deal with 2-level JSON, imagine if this JSON is 5 or 7-level deep! That's why we'll use DinoQL to parse data to get only the data we need. It is quite simple, we just take the raw data as a first argument, and then write our GraphQL-like query:

```js
const App = () => {
  const [results, setResults] = useState({ articles: []})
  const [val, setVal] = useState('JavaScript')

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${val}&sortBy=popularity&apiKey=${process.env.TOKEN}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setResults(
        dql(data)`
          totalResults
          articles {
            title
            author
            description
            url
          }
        `
        ))
  }, [val])
```

So, every time input value changes, we fetch data again and parse only things we need - total results of all the articles; title, author, description and url for each article.

For layout we'll use our styled components that we wrote before and state values too:

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [results, setResults] = useState({ articles: [] })
  const [val, setVal] = useState('JavaScript')

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=${val}&sortBy=popularity&apiKey=${process.env.TOKEN}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data =>
        setResults(
          dql(data)`
          totalResults
          articles {
            title
            author
            description
            url
          }
        `
        )
      )
  }, [val])

  return (
    <div>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <Header>News App 📰</Header>
      <Input value={val} onInput={e => setVal(e.target.value)} />
      <h4>Total results: {results.totalResults}</h4>
      <Results>
        {results.articles.map(item => (
          <li>
            <h3>{item.title}</h3>
            <h5>by {item.author}</h5>
            <p>{item.description}</p>
            <a target="_blank" href={item.url}>
              Read more
            </a>
          </li>
        ))}
      </Results>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Great! We wrote our news app. Only need to render it in our container:

```jsx
render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'))
```

Our app works fine. The only problem is layout changes after the content loads. But you can pass some "lorem ipsum" articles to initial state of `results`:

```js
const [results, setResults] = useState({ articles: [
  {
    // Write your test article here
]})
```

## Conclusion

We made a simple web app using existing APIs. There a lot of interesting APIs that can be used as a skeleton for your app. I picked both the simplest and most interesting API I could find.

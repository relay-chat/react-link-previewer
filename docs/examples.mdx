# Component example

`react-link-previewer` has a built in component that shows a link preview on hover.

<Playground>
  <LinkPreview link="https://relaychat.app">RelayChat</LinkPreview> (hover to see preview)
</Playground>

# Hook example

In case you want to build your own component there is a hook for it which returns an object containing error and data objects.

<Playground>
  {() => {
    const {data, error } = useLinkPreview({
      link: 'https://relaychat.app'
    })
    return (
      <>
       {data && <span>site title: {data.title}</span>}
      </>
    )
  }}
</Playground>

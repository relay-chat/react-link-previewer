# react-link-previewer ðŸ“°

Service and a component for previewing links. Used in [Relay](https://relaychat.app/).

## Component

### Installation

```sh

yarn add react-link-previewer
# pnpm / npm
npm i react-link-previewer
```

### Example

import React from 'react'
import Preview from 'react-link-previewer'

render(<Preview link="https://relaychat.app" />, document.getElementById('app'))
```

### Props

```ts
link: string;
host?: string;
classNames?: {
    heading: string;
    description: string;
    image: string;
    website: string;
}
```

- **link** - link to a website
- **host** - hostname of an HTTP metadata service
- **classNames** - a list of classNames to be used in a component

## Service

### Why service?

Making requests with `fetch` is blocked by most websites, so a service does these requests instead.

### How it works

1. URL is being parsed for `?link=<link>`
2. HTTP service uses `opengraph` package to parse website's metadata
3. It displays them in JSON format.

### Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/relay-chat/react-link-previewer.git
go run service/main.go
```

You can edit headers and port for your needs.
